#Lab 1 

#i. Design a very basic function, such as adding two numbers, or incrementing an input by 1.

x= int(input("Enter a number you wish to increment by 1"))
def my_function(x):
    return x+1
print(my_function(x))

# ii.	What requirements should this function have?  For example, time to complete, robustness to user input, etc.
# - Return the result to the user 
#Â - Should be quick and instantaneous and clear
