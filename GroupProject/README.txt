Graph created as part of my group presentation on: "Retirement Ages Across the World". 
Graph is a spotlight 

â€‹Data sources:
Average Retirement Effective men:
 https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-effective-retirement-men

Average Reirement Effective women:
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-effective-retirement-women

Within the code, I have created 3 time/line graphs:
1. OECD average retirement age vs average men retirement age
2. OECD average retirement age vs average women retirement age
3. Average men retirement age vs average women retirement age

Out of these three charts, the last was selected in the PowerPoint as I believed
it was the easiest to read and allowed for easier comparisons between average retirement
for men and women.

The CSV was both datasets merged in Alteryx.
